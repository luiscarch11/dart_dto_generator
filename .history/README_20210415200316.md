# Union Generator

## What inspired us?

When it comes to writting clean code, Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) help us separating stuff in a proper way. The problem comes when we need to create as many DTOs as models and this turns into a repetitive and painful job.

This is why I've created this extension, which allows us to generate _fromJson_, _toJson_, _fromDomain_ and _toDomain_ methods the fastest way, without writting repetitive code over and over again.

## Usage

This extension works by creating a _template_ class that will help us know what to generate next. The expected structure is as follows:

```dart
class YourClassName{
    final String firstVariable;
    final int secondVariable;
    final CustomType thirdVariable;
}
```

This example allows us to generate the mentioned metho

To activate generation you must place the cursor in the class declaration line, and press _cntrl (cmd) + ._

## Why would I use _Unions_?

This is a perfect solution since you don't need to remember every single possible value that an instance can have, as the provided methods will handle this task themselves.

## What to do if you can't generate the Unions

Here we'll describe some cases where you could have some troubles trying to use the extension.

First of all, as it's on a very early stage, some cases are not (yet) supported:

- **Dart version < 2.12.0**. You'll need to upgrade to (at least) dart version _2.12.0_ so you can use this extension.

# Support

We highly encourage you to create a pull request for this extension if you want to improve it. Your help is always welcome. Also, you can open issues if there's any trouble.
